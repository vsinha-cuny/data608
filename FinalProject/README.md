### Description

Interactive Shiny app to show government
spending on healthcares, as well as healthcare coverage levels, across countries of
the world. The app is deployed on shinyapps.io, at https://vsinha.shinyapps.io/finalproject/

The graph will allow the user to select two countries, and compare their respective
public health expenditures (relative to GDP) as well as their life expectancies
on a side-by-side plot.
Sidebar panels will allow selection of two countries from dropdown menus. The main
panel, and other plots will then show the relevant data and comparisons for the
selected countries.
This plot can be used to visualize and compare public healthcare expenditures in
countries.
